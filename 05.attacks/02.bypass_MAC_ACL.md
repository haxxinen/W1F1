#### 2.1. Find MAC address of client (station)
```
# iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
# airodump-ng wlan0 # look for MAC addresses of connected clients
# iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
```


#### 2.2. Change MAC address
```
# ifconfig wlan0 down
# ifconfig wlan0 hw ether DE:AD:BE:EF:FF:FF
# ifconfig wlan0 up
```
Note: 
- if client is associated already, deauth attack allows you to swap positions
- actual client = deauthenticated / your machine = associated
