#### 1.1. WiFi assessment checklist

- encryption type
  - WPA2 as preferred mode
  - open network means no encryption

- PSK/WPS-PIN/certificate management
  - static vs. dynamic passwords
  - PSK printed on device label
  - password/PIN pattern format

- deauthentication / DoS attack

- instrument WPS attacks if configured on device
  - WPS pin brute-force
  - default WPS PIN `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJE5YYSP-wHUu5-smIMTmJNu84XAviw-yyTmHyVGmT0`
  - common WPS PIN from other devices

- test against krack attack / other known protocol weaknesses

- router services exposure
  - as authenticated user from WLAN/LAN
  - as unauthenticated user from WAN/Internet

- AP exposure via crowd-source solutions (wigle.net / www.wifimap.io)

- automatic client connection
  - via known fake SSID (from probe request)
  - via "pushed" network [TO BE RESEARCHED]

- credentials harvesting
  - passive: common password lists / crowd-source lists
  - active: phishing / social engineering (deaut + fake AP `wifiphisher`)
