#### 1.1. Connect to WiFi network
```
# apt-get install wpasupplicant -yqq
# wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase <SSID> <PSK>)
# dhclient wlan0
```


#### 1.2. Example of `wpa_supplicant` config file
```
# wpa_passphrase TEST1 TEST11111 >> wpa_supplicant.conf
# cat wpa_supplicant.conf
network={
    ssid="TEST2"
    key_mgmt=NONE
    priority=100
}
network={
	ssid="TEST1"
	#psk="TEST11111"
	psk=8ec620d31b84d1ba0348b5b083abf4ef955a488bf956c0343f61fc348cb01f2b
}
```


#### 1.3. Stable connection on 5GHz (rtl8812au driver)

Setup:
```
# service NetworkManager stop # for Debian with GUI
# killall wpa_supplicant 2>/dev/null && killall dhclient 2>/dev/null
# modprobe -r 8812au && modprobe 8812au # 8812au or 88XXau
# ifconfig wlan0 down && ifconfig wlan0 up
# wpa_supplicant -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase <SSID> <PSK>)
```

Successful connection log:
```
Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant
wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-REGDOM-CHANGE init=BEACON_HINT type=UNKNOWN
wlan0: Trying to associate with de:ad:be:ef:00:07 (SSID='DeadBeef' freq=5220 MHz)
wlan0: Associated with de:ad:be:ef:00:07
wlan0: WPA: Key negotiation completed with de:ad:be:ef:00:07 [PTK=CCMP GTK=CCMP]

wlan0: WPA: Group rekeying completed with de:ad:be:ef:00:07 [GTK=CCMP]
```

What might break the connection:
```
RTM_NEWLINK: ifi_index=17 ifname=wlan0 operstate=2 linkmode=1 ifi_family=0 ifi_flags=0x1003 ([UP])
```

Unstable connection log upon reconnect:
```

wlan0: Blacklist count 1 --> request scan in 100 ms
wlan0: Ignore new scan request for 0.100000 sec since an earlier request is scheduled to trigger sooner
```


#### 1.4. Fixing the routing table and DNS
```
# route -n # check current routing table
# route delete default gateway <current gateway>
# dhclient wlan0
# echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
```
